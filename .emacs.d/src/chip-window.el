;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains code for managing windows.

;;; Code:

;; When splitting windows, I often also want to switch to the new buffer
(after-load (general)
  (general-define-key
   "C-x 2" (lambda () (interactive) (split-window-vertically) (other-window 1))
   "C-x 3" (lambda () (interactive) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1))))

;; Save window configurations as bookmarks
(use-package burly
  :bind (("C-c w s" . burly-bookmark-windows))
  :config
  (setq burly-bookmark-prefix "win: "))
